# 📰 Fake News Detector 🕵️‍♂️

This is a simple web app built with **Streamlit** that detects whether a news article is **Real** or **Fake** using a trained machine learning model. Just enter the news title and content, and the app will predict the authenticity of the article along with a confidence score and a word cloud of the input.

## 🔎 Overview

- Fake news spreads quickly online and can cause real-world consequences.  
- This project uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **PassiveAggressiveClassifier** to classify news headlines.  
- The app provides an **interactive interface** where users can test single headlines or evaluate a batch of headlines via CSV.

## 🚀 Features

✔️ Predict if a single news headline is REAL or FAKE.

✔️ Show confidence score for predictions.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The news **title** and **content** are combined and vectorized using a TF-IDF vectorizer.
2. A trained machine learning model classifies the text as `FAKE` or `REAL`.
3. The result is shown along with a confidence score and a word cloud visualization.
4. Users can optionally save the prediction result as a CSV file.
5. For bulk evaluation, users can upload a CSV file (Title, Label) → the app calculates Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, and allows exporting results.
